•	What US county has recorded the highest average corn yield since 1990?
```{r}

###Question 1

#checking to see if corn is in "COMMODITY_DESC", it is!
sorted_comm_desc<-unique(NASS[,sort(COMMODITY_DESC)])

#not sure which field indicates yield amount...but "VALUE" seems like the best candidate
#when imported, value is a character - need to change it to numeric
value_num <- gsub(",","",NASS$VALUE)
#write to numeric vector, to then add as a column
numbers<-as.numeric(value_num)

#changing VALUE to column to numeric 
NASS[, double_val := numbers] 
#corn[, numeric_val := numbers]
NASS[, value_tons := numbers]

#get all records in NASS that have CORN (case sensitive!) for "COMMODITY_DESC"
corn<-NASS[COMMODITY_DESC %like% "CORN"]

#make sure just for counties
corn_by_county<-corn[AGG_LEVEL_DESC %like% "COUNTY"]
# looking for only records that indicate corn yield
corn_yield<-corn_by_county[SHORT_DESC %like% "YIELD"]


#how many records in corn_yield
nrow(corn_yield)
#how many records in corn_yield have value_tons less than 1
nrow(corn_yield[corn_yield$value_tons<1,])

###the next concern is that the units for corn are not all the same??
#CORN & SORGHUM (56 lb/bu) 1 bushel = .0254 metric ton. 1 metric ton = 39.368 bushels.
value_tons <- "value_tons"
for (i in value_tons) { 
  corn_yield[get(i)== SHORT_DESC %like% "BU", eval(i) := double_val*.0245]
}

#check corn_yield rows to see if accidentally modified
nrow(corn_yield)
#check less than 1 to see if a chunk of rows were modified, yes!
nrow(corn_yield[corn_yield$value_tons<1,])

#want yield by county code, broken into unique STATE_FIPS_CODE, value_tons averaged over all the years from 1990 to present records
corn_subset<-corn_yield[YEAR>=1990,.(avg_corn=mean(value_tons)),by=.(STATE_FIPS_CODE,STATE_NAME,COUNTY_CODE,COUNTY_NAME)]

#removes NA's for avg_corn so max works
county_maxcorn<-corn_subset[corn_subset$avg_corn==max(corn_subset$avg_corn,na.rm=TRUE),]

county_maxcorn

```

•	What is the highest reported annual corn yield? In what county?
```{r}
###Question 2
#for all entries for a given year, sum them to get one annual yield in tons
#return the county associated with this value
corn_county_year<-corn_yield[,.(annual_yield=sum(value_tons)),by=.(YEAR,STATE_FIPS_CODE,COUNTY_CODE,COUNTY_NAME)][order(-annual_yield)]

corn_county_year

```

•	What state has the most acres of soy in 2014?

```{r}
by_state<-NASS[AGG_LEVEL_DESC %like% "STATE"]
#check to see if "soy" is in the commodity description, yes!
soy<-by_state[COMMODITY_DESC %like% "SOY"]
#
soy_short_desc<-soy[SHORT_DESC %like% "SOY"]
soy_short_desc_acres<-soy_short_desc[SHORT_DESC %like% "ACRES"]
soy_short_desc_planted<-soy_short_desc_acres[SHORT_DESC %like% "PLANTED"]

soy_state_acres_2014<-soy_short_desc_planted[YEAR==2014,.(state_total=sum(double_val)),by=.(YEAR,STATE_NAME,STATE_FIPS_CODE)][order(-state_total)]

soy_state_acres_2014
```
•	What state has the highest average land fraction used for soy production since 1990?

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
